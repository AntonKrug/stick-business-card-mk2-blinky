# Introduction

I made unique business cards for myself, they are just narrow "sticks" which fit into a USB connector directly. The simplest variants can just have a `ATMEGA88` chip with LED to perform 'morse code' and other types of blinkies:

However there are more populated variants which can have own dedicated ISP connector (1.27mm pin pitch) and with few more passives have software implemented USB HID capabilities:

One variant has soldered pin headers on the edges and is simple, yet full dev board:

This repository is documenting the "breadboard" variant, showing the pinout of the connectors and contains small morse code blinky project.
